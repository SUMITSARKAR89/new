                <p>The painting depicts a group of prisoners walking in a circle around a claustrophobic prison yard, surrounded by brick walls with a few small arched windows high up. The prisoners are parading past detectives so they would remember the criminal's faces. The work is dominated by depressing tones of blue and green in the shadowy depths of the yard, with splashes of red on the better lit bricks above, and two small white butterflies higher up. One prisoner at the front of the group, without a cap, whose features may resemble Vincent's, has turned his head to look out at the viewer. The scene recalls Van Gogh's own detention, and his psychological isolation.nizable paintings in Western art. </p>

                <p>Vincent van Gogh’s energetic brushstrokes, vibrant palettes, and free-flowing forms turned the artist’s scenes into dynamic evocations of the artist’s inner life and extensive studies. His landscapes, portraits, still lifes, and interiors are among art history’s most recognizable and influential works. Van Gogh’s signature style exemplified the tenets of Post-Impressionism and influenced German Expressionism and the development of modernism itself. Van Gogh did not find much success in his lifetime, but after his death in 1890, his works began to garner cachet thanks to the skillful promotion of his sister-in-law, Jo van Gogh-Bonger. Van Gogh’s paintings belong in the collections of institutions such as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Tate, the Museum of Modern Art, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and they consistently sell for tens of millions on the secondary market.</p>

                <p>Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful, but showed signs of mental instability. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a missionary in southern Belgium. Later he drifted in ill-health and solitude. He was keenly aware of modernist trends in art and, while back with his parents, took up painting in 1881. His younger brother, Theo, supported him financially, and the two of them kept up a long correspondence by letter.</p>
